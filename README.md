## Crazy Cannonz

### Introduction

	Crazy Cannonz is a 2D platformer that involves moving "cannoneers" around a map that consists of many platforms. Players can pick up 3 types of ammunition from various colored crates around each map. Players can then fire the cannonballs at each other. Hitting opponents will earn you points while being hit deducts points. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins the round. Users have a choice of playing with up to four players locally on one machine, or online with several machines.
